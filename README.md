### expresschatapp
Rather simple chat-app in socketio. warmup before better projects like that.  
Info:
- Completely ignore index.html, thats left just as a reference (when i was trying to connect back and front using socketio docs)
- Backend is in server.js file
- Frontned io scripts are in views/partials/scripts.ejs
- Styles are in public/style.css

Simple project, but i liked that. Finally i feel like doing backend in JS has something cool and done better that other languages...

Great project for reference, it shows how to connect things (back, front, socket) to build chat.
